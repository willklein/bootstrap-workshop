# Bootstrap Workshop with InnovateCU

- [Download this project](https://github.com/wklein/bootstrap-workshop/archive/master.zip) to get started.
- Open index.html in your favorite editor
- What are you wating for?

Each assignment contains a couple of images that shows the desired result. The idea is to compose the desired layouts and styles by writing the HTML with appropriate Bootstrap classes and IDs. LESS/CSS editing should not be necessary, but feel free to add your own style if you feel like it. 

Questions? Grab me or [ping @willslab at Twitter](https://twitter.com/willslab).

## Assignment 6: Tooltips

Javascript!

Time to name your images/kittens. Add [tooltips](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) that tells the name of the image/kitten.

To do this tasks you'll need to use Javascript. Add all code into `<script></script>` at the bottom of `index.html`, just before `</body>`.

__Tips__: Easiest is probably to use `$('img').tooltip();` and then use `data-` attributes.

## Assignment 7: Build your own site

Use Bootstrap to setup a personal website or landing page for your startup!
- Start with a single page site
- Try GitHub Pages for free hosting
- Need a startup idea? Make something up, or use a generator like [this one](http://itsthisforthat.com/).

I guess that's it. Awesome work! Feel free to show me your site :)
