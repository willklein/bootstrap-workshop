# Bootstrap Workshop with InnovateCU

- [Download this project](https://github.com/willklein/bootstrap-workshop/archive/master.zip) to get started.
- Open index.html in your favorite editor
- Get to work!

Each assignment contains a couple of images that shows the desired result. The idea is to compose the desired layouts and styles by writing the HTML with appropriate Bootstrap classes and IDs. LESS/CSS editing should not be necessary, but you can add your own style if you feel like it. 

Questions? Ask me or one of the coaches for help. I'll work through the workshop assignments on the big screen too, so you can follow along if you're lost at all. Feel free to ask questions about what I'm doing too.

#### Extra

* If you get stuck with an assignment, ask for help or skip it!
* Tips: Like the kittens? Use [PlaceKitten](http://placekitten.com/) example:  `<img src="http://placekitten.com/400/300" class="img-responsive">` (change 400/300 to get other pictures for other resolutions)
* Tips 2: Think kittens are boring? Use [PlaceSheen](http://placesheen.com/) example:  `<img src="http://placesheen.com/400/300" class="img-responsive">` (change 400/300 to get other pictures for other resolutions)
* Note: See `class="img-responsive"`? [Read more at getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview-responsive-images)

## Assignment 6: Tooltips

JavaScript!

Time to name your images/kittens. Add [tooltips](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) that display the name of the image/kitten.

To do these tasks you'll need to use JavaScript. Add all code into `<script></script>` at the bottom of `index.html`, just before `</body>`.

__Tips__: Easiest way to set this up is probably using `$('img').tooltip();` and then use `data-` attributes.

## Assignment 7: Build your own site

Use Bootstrap to setup a personal website, or a landing page for your startup!
- Start with a single page site.
- Need a startup idea? Make something up, or use a silly generator like [this one](http://itsthisforthat.com/).

When you're done, show me your site!
